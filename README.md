Very simple script to transfer style from one image to a content image. Sample images are included. Inspired by tensorflow guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer

Use video.py to transfer style to video as well. Very long runtime.

Requirements (most recent version for all):
1. matplotlib
2. tensorflow keras
3. numpy
4. PIL
5. OpenCV
